1) From your product backlog, break the number of features such that are distributed across multiple sprints. 

2) Each sprint will last for a certain number of days. These days are listed below. Your first sprint will begin on 17th June 2020. 

Here are the start and end dates for each of the sprint towards Assignment2A:

Sprint1 is from 17th June (12:01 am) to 23rd June (11:59 pm)  
Sprint2 is from 24th June (12:01 am) to 30th June (11:59 pm) 
Sprint3 is from 1st July (12:01 am) to 8th July  (11:59 pm)

3) Before start of each sprint, create a sprint backlog. Your sprint backlog will contain clearly what you as a team plan to accomplish in that sprint and how these tasks(code, testing, update of crc cards, etc etc) are distributed across team members. The scrum leader must take the lead on this. 

4) The filename for your sprint backlog will be:

Sprint#Backlog.txt 

For example: 
Sprint1Backlog.txt
Sprint2Backlog.txt

5) This backlog must be the very first thing you will do at start of sprint. You cannot begin with the implementation or any phase of your project without first creating a sprint backlog for that sprint. 

6) Remember this is easy for me to  check by comparing SVN time stamps.

7) If you have certain tasks that did not get completed in the sprint. Make sure to mention these and enter them in the start of the next sprint backlog. 

For Example: 


//Sprint # Backlog.  
June XX to June XX
