a) What did I work on in the last three days? 
	- Implemented the Speak command so it checks valid input
	- Implemented the ErrorCheck and Validation class 
	- Edited the commands and parse class to meet certain requirements 

b) What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Work on the filesystem class and make it work for commands like mkdir, cd, pwd, and more
	- Change CRC cards to meet finalized design
	- Test the speak command and make sure it works completely
	- Check if pushd and popd are working properly 

c) Am I blocked on anything?  
	- Just on the implementation to filesystem, but working on the issue
