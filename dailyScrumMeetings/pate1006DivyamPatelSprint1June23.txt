a) What did I work on in the last three days? 
	- Worked on speak class and got a basic implementation done 
	- Worked on the parse class that calls the appropriate method 
	- Basic Output class done for speak command

b) What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Get the speak command completely done 
	- Start doing the error check class and checking if the input is correct for commands already implemented 
	- Finalize the project design if things need to be changed 
	- Start working on other commands, like pushd, popd, cd, mkdir, and ls 

c) Am I blocked on anything?  
	- Filesystem needs to get appropriate implementation so other commands can be completely finished
