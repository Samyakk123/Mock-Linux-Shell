What did I work on in the last three days?
- Finished Man class (i.e UserManual)
- Added all the statements and outlines that go for each command
- added Output as a collaborator and got printing onto the terminal functionality working via the output class
- Added it as a collaborator with ParceClass and got the current functionality working
- Planned for future classes I want to work on for sprint 2 

What did I plan to work in the next three days??
- Implementing the history class
- Updating the parce class to keep track of the previously called commands
- Begin thinking about how the pushd and popd implementations should work
- Begin basic implementation of the pushd and popd classes

Am I blocked on anything?
