What did I work on in the last three days?
- Finished testing cp, mv, and rm
- Brainstormed idea for redirection implementation and ideas
- Decided more efficient ways to implement other classes

What did I plan to work in the next three days??
- Implementing the redirection for commands
- Plan out testing, curling, etc.
- Ls -R command
- Validation for the Ls -R command

Am I blocked on anything?
- No
