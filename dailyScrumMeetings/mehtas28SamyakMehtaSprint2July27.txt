What did I work on in the last three days?
- Finished Cp and Mv up to implementation 
-Did validation for rm command, cp command, mv command
- Fixed implementation to work with multiple pathways
- Brainstormed idea for redirection (and began implementation)

What did I plan to work in the next three days??
- Finish redirection
- Work more on validation 
- Error checking
- JUnit testing
- JavaDoc and Commenting

Am I blocked on anything?
- No
