a) What did I work on in the last three days? 
	- Brainstormed ideas for the different classes and created crc cards for them 
	- Created a basic implementation for the ParseClass and the Commands class 
	- Created all the classes needed for sprint 1 related to my responsibilities 

b) What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Get the SpeakCommand working, finish ParceClass implementation necessary for current sprint
	- Start working on basic implementation of Output class

c) Am I blocked on anything?  
	- Contemplating how the correct command should be called in the ParseClass without a bunch of if statements
