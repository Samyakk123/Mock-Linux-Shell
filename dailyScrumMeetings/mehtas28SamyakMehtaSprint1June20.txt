What did I work on in the last three days?
- Finsished JShell and Exit up to current implementation
- Brainstormed implementation of ParseClass with group and helped with errors
- Brainstormed ideas for history and how it can be implemented
- Worked on the CRC cards with group (we did this together)

What did I plan to work in the next three days??
- start and finish the UserManual
- Use parceClass in the JShell so that the corresponding method can be called

Am I blocked on anything?
- Need parceClass method implementations to finish so parceClass can be used in JShell
