What did I work on in the last three days?
- Finished cp, mv, and rm commands
- Validation of cp, mv and rm commands (not for specific cases yet)
- Brainstormed implementation for find and ls -R commands

What did I plan to work in the next three days??
- validate specific cases for mv and cp
- Work on ls -R command

Am I blocked on anything?
- No
