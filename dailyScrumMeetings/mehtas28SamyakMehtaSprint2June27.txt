What did I work on in the last three days?
- Finished StackClass, Pushed, Popd (without testing yet because not yet capable of doing so)
- intialized methods in FileSystem and ParceClass
- Worked together to decide new algorithm for FileClass 
- Implemented the History class and got it working

What did I plan to work in the next three days??
- Help fully implement the new fileSystem method
- test stackCalss, pushed, and popped when possible
- Bug test history classes for any edge cases
- Help implement cat class

Am I blocked on anything?
- No
